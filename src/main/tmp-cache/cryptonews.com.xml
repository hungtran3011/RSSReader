<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Token Unlocks highlighted that Arbitrum will do a ‚ÄúCliff Unlock,‚Äù where tokens are released in a lump sum at the deadline.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Arbitrum Prepares for $2.32 Billion Token Unlock on March 16</span></strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://token.unlocks.app/arbitrum" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to data from Token Unlocks</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, approximately 1.1 billion locked ARB tokens will be unlocked, constituting roughly 76% of the token&#8217;s circulating supply.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Of the unlocked tokens, Arbitrum will allocate 673.5 million tokens, valued at around $1.41 billion at current prices, to its team and advisers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Additionally, 438.25 million tokens, worth approximately $915 million, will be released for investors. Token Unlocks clarified that this will be a &#8220;Cliff Unlock,&#8221; meaning no tokens are initially released until the specified unlock date, upon which a lump sum will be introduced into the market.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unlocks are staggered releases of cryptocurrencies that have been frozen to prevent early investors or project team members from selling in large numbers. The Cliff Unlock method allows for unfreezing a certain number of tokens immediately after a predetermined period, after which unfreezing happens in a linear schedule.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Following the March 16 release, Arbitrum will continue to unfreeze a certain amount of tokens every four weeks for four years, <a href="https://twitter.com/Token_Unlocks/status/1691648214553014458">Token Unlocks¬†</a></span><a href="https://twitter.com/Token_Unlocks/status/1691648214553014458"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">noted</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://twitter.com/Token_Unlocks/status/1691648214553014458">¬†in a tweet</a>.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite a positive trend in the sector overall, ARB emerged as the weakest performer among the top five L2 tokens, experiencing a decrease of over 2% during the reporting period, while the sector showcased an average gain of 3.8%.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor ‚Äì whose company now owns 205,000 Bitcoin (BTC) ‚Äì says people should buy and HODL their coins 100 years.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI would encourage people to think of it as digital property ‚Äì a billion-dollar building in cyberspace,‚Äù Michael Saylor told <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1767178599390458285">CNBC</a> in an interview on Monday. ‚ÄúHold it for 100 years.‚Äù</p>
<h2>More Bitcoin Bought by Michael Saylor&#8217;s MicroStrategy</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Earlier that morning, Saylor announced yet another <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1767158870294605904">seismic Bitcoin purchase</a> of $800 million at an average price of $68,377 per coin.</p>
<p>The new purchase was funded using proceeds from a recently announced <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-25.htm">$700 million convertible note offering</a>, on which the firm is paying a meager 0.625% interest, and is due for repayment in 2030.</p>
<p>His company is now the world‚Äôs largest corporate holder of BTC, and nearly holds 1% of the entire BTC supply that will ever exist. His conviction to buy more not only comes from his core beliefs as a Bitcoin maximalist, but also the premise that BTC isn‚Äôt meant to be sold ‚Äì or spent ‚Äì at all.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPeople refer to it as ‚Äòdigital currency,‚Äô and that‚Äôs an unfortunate historical artifact,‚Äù Saylor said, likening the asset to valuable real estate property. ‚ÄúThe compelling use case is capital preservation for everyone in the world.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> is Digital Property. It is superior to other investments such as Gold, Equity, or Real Estate because it is digital, available, global, ethical, &amp; useful to millions of companies and billions of people. <a href="https://t.co/738dblB0Zt">pic.twitter.com/738dblB0Zt</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Michael Saylor<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a1.png" alt="‚ö°" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@saylor) <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1767178599390458285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 11, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The executive noted that Bitcoin‚Äôs total addressable market as a store of value is a whopping $100 trillion, compared to the $1 trillion market for a desirable medium of exchange. Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap today is still under $1.5 trillion and slightly over that of silver, leaving ample room for growth.</p>
<h2>Michael Saylor Says Don‚Äôt Call Bitcoin A Currency</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meanwhile, the asset‚Äôs use case as property is far less ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù or troubling with regulators than its use as a medium of exchange.</p>
<p>Indeed, many of Bitcoin‚Äôs loudest critics, including Elizabeth Warren, Jamie Dimon, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-chairman-gensler-comments-on-bitcoin-and-ethereum-avoids-ethereum-security-classification.htm">Gary Gensler</a>, consider money laundering one of Bitcoin‚Äôs primary transactional use cases, while much political focus around crypto surrounds the regulation of stablecoins, exchanges, and other facilitators of payments and trade.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have to be a currency,‚Äù Michael Saylor said. ‚ÄúNobody‚Äôs trying to buy a cup of coffee with a fraction of their building on Fifth Avenue.‚Äù</p>
<p>The billionaire added that Bitcoin will ‚Äúeat gold‚Äù ‚Äì whose monetary properties are inferior to Bitcoin, yet whose market cap is still ten times the size. Bitcoin spot ETFs, which first launched in the United States two months ago, are now over half the size of all gold ETFs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs competing with risk assets as a long-term hold, and it‚Äôs competing with you buying an Airbnb as a retirement income source if you‚Äôre a middle-class person,‚Äù Saylor concluded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A South Korean law firm operator was jailed in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-city-busan-names-digital-exchange-preferred-bidder.htm">Busan</a> on March 11 after being found guilty of stealing clients‚Äô money to spend on crypto investments.</p>
<p>The media outlet <a href="https://www.newsis.com/view/?id=NISX20240311_0002655389" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsis</a> reported that the case was heard at the Criminal Division of the Busan District Court. The court sentenced an unnamed individual in their 50s to 20 months in jail.</p>
<h2>South Korean Law Firm Boss ‚ÄòEmbezzled Client Money‚Äô</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The lawyer stole $170,000 on December 27, 2021, the court heard. Prosecutors said the lawyer transferred money from a company account into their personal bank account.</p>
<p>The money came from a corporate client, who had given the money to the firm to complete a real estate deal as part of a trust contract.</p>
<p>However, the court heard, the accused instead ‚Äústole the money and used it for personal purposes,‚Äù namely crypto investments.</p>
<p>On another occasion, the court heard, the South Korean law firm chief stole a registration fee from a private client worth just under $1,700.</p>
<p>The crypto investments appear to have been ill-fated. Prosecutors said they were unable to retrieve any of the stolen funds.</p>
<p>The presiding judge, Justice Jeong Soon-yeol of the District Court‚Äôs 11th Criminal Division, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúThe amount of damage sustained is large. And none of the stolen money has been recovered. Considering these factors, I have no choice but to hand out a severe punishment in this case.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<h2>South Korean City Sees Rise in Crypto-related Crime?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Busan judges are no stranger to crypto-related cases. In December last year, police in the southern city <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-police-shut-down-gangsters-32m-crypto-scam-ring.htm">swooped on a gang of over 80 suspected crypto scammers</a>.</p>

If approved, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2024/03/11/fact-sheet-the-presidents-budget-cuts-taxes-for-working-families-and-makes-big-corporations-and-the-wealthy-pay-their-fair-share/">Biden‚Äôs $7.3 trillion budget proposal</a> would see the federal government crack down on crypto ‚Äúwash sales,‚Äù wherein a cryptocurrency holder sells an asset at a loss ‚Äúto reduce their tax burden‚Äù just to buy it back shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>The budget proposal states that it will eliminate the tax subsidy by ‚Äúmodernizing the tax code‚Äôs anti-abuse rules to apply to crypto assets just like they apply to stocks and other securities.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Budget saves billions of dollars by closing other tax loopholes that overwhelmingly benefit the rich and the largest, most profitable corporations,‚Äù the proposal reads, including ‚Äúclosing a loophole that benefits wealthy crypto investors.‚Äù</p>
<p>Similarly, the proposed budget would implement a 30% excise tax corresponding to the cost of energy used by crypto mining firms, according to the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/131/General-Explanations-FY2025.pdf">U.S. Treasury Department‚Äôs</a> annual ‚Äúgreenbook.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe increase in energy consumption attributable to the growth of digital asset mining has negative environmental effects and can have environmental justice implications as well as increase energy prices for those that share an electricity grid with digital asset miners,‚Äù the Treasury‚Äôs explanation states.</p>
<h2><strong>House Republicans Push Back On Budget Proposal</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Biden‚Äôs 2025 budget faces an uphill battle as Congressional Republicans stand to oppose the proposal. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/president-joe-biden-critiques-wealthy-crypto-investors-twitter.htm">The President</a> attempted to close the wash sale loophole and implement a crypto mining tax in previous years to no avail.</p>
<p>&#8220;The price tag of President Biden&#8217;s proposed budget is yet another glaring reminder of this Administration&#8217;s insatiable appetite for reckless spending and the Democrats&#8217; disregard for fiscal responsibility,‚Äù a statement released by Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) alongside House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN), House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA), and Representative Elise Stefanik (R-NY) reads. ‚ÄúBiden&#8217;s budget doesn&#8217;t just miss the mark &#8211; it is a roadmap to accelerate America&#8217;s decline.‚Äù</p>

<p>Political tensions between Democrats and Republicans continue to simmer as the 2024 presidential election heats up following Super Tuesday and Biden&#8217;s State of the Union Address last week.</p>
<h2><strong>Biden Versus Trump Rematch All But Confirmed</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has come out seemingly in support of cryptocurrencies despite admitting he was &#8220;not a fan&#8221; previously, most recently revealing that his newly released sneaker line is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/trump-flips-stance-on-bitcoin-im-not-sure-if-id-want-to-take-it-away-at-this-point.htm">accepting payments in bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Biden has pushed for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/crypto-regulations/">regulatory guidance on the cryptocurrency industry</a>, going so far as to issue an executive order on &#8220;ensuring the responsible development of cryptocurrency investments&#8221; in 2022.</p>
<p>The 2020 presidential candidates are seemingly poised to face off once again in November once both formally secure their party&#8217;s candidacy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zac Prince, the former BlockFi CEO, is breaking into real estate tech now that his defunct crypto lending firm is on a safe path to recovery.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Excited to announce that I‚Äôve joined the team at RE Cost Seg as CEO!</p>
<p>RE Cost Seg provides cost segregation studies to real estate investors. Cost segregation studies enable real estate investors to take advantage of tax benefits by accelerating depreciation.  </p>
<p>When you hear‚Ä¶</p>
<p>&mdash; Zac Prince (@CostSegZac) <a href="https://twitter.com/CostSegZac/status/1767171382469652757?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 11, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/CostSegZac/status/1767171382469652757">statement to X</a> on Monday, Prince revealed that he is now the CEO of Re Cost Seg, a firm that provides cost segregation studies to real estate investors.</p>
<h2>BlockFi CEO Pivots To Real Estate</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Cost segregation studies survey each element of a property and look for certain things that could benefit from accelerated ‚Äúdepreciation‚Äù ‚Äì the period in which a renovator pays for costs associated with improving a property.</p>
<p>This will allow customers to claim tax benefits for accelerating depreciation on those elements, which could include plumbing fixtures, carpeting, and sidewalks, among other things.</p>
<p>Extolling his company‚Äôs benefits against more traditional competition, Prince wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúBecause of lower price points and streamlined processes, RE Cost Seg is making this valuable tax-saving tool available to a much broader group of real estate investors. Previously it was generally limited to larger, commercial properties.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>Prince clarified that his business will still primarily focus on institutional clients, but still work with some single-family clients once ‚Äúpriced out‚Äù of the opportunity.</p>
<p>The focus marks a pivot from Prince‚Äôs retail-oriented crypto lending firm, which offered average investors a chance to earn a yield on their BTC and to take out loans against their coins.</p>
<p>BlockFi‚Äôs business model involved rehypothecating those coins to their institutional clients, where they would earn a slightly higher yield than they offered their retail clients, and profit on the difference.</p>
<p>One of their largest counterparties, however, was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockfi-to-receive-874-5-million-from-settlement-with-ftx-and-alameda-research.htm">Alameda Research ‚Äì FTX‚Äôs sister trading firm that imploded last year</a>, losing BlockFi‚Äôs and its customers‚Äô coins in the process.</p>
<p>While focused on the ensuing bankruptcy for over a year afterward, Prince said on Sunday that he‚Äôs now comfortable moving on to other things.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúWith estate distributions in flight, and knowing the FTX estate recoveries are trending in a positive direction‚Ä¶ I felt that I finally had an appropriate amount of closure to move on to new professional endeavors,‚Äù he said.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Settling One Last Bet</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Prince‚Äôs followers were quick to <a href="https://twitter.com/americanhodl8/status/1766867985199948145">call him out on Sunday</a> for having neglected to honor his side of a public bet he made with popular Bitcoiner @americanhodl8 on X.</p>
<p>In 2021, both men bet 1 BTC on whether BlockFi would remain a functional company over the next 37 years. BlockFi‚Äôs collapse one year later left Prince as the loser, owing 1 BTC ‚Äì now worth over $72,000 ‚Äì to his Twitter adversary.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dm me &#8211; will get it sorted</p>
<p>&mdash; Zac Prince (@CostSegZac) <a href="https://twitter.com/CostSegZac/status/1766924096565080432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>On Sunday, the former executive agreed that he would ‚Äúget it sorted.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eclipse Labs, a multilayered blockchain builder, has raised $50 million in funding to fuel the launch of its solution for scaling the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://x.com/EclipseFND/status/1767212277285969979?s=20">announcement was made on March 11 via the X</a> (formerly Twitter) handle, just weeks before the mainnet launch.</p>
<h2>Eclipse Labs‚Äô Developer-First Focus Approach</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Eclipse Labs offers a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-layer-2-blockchain-tokens.htm">flexible Layer-2 solution</a> (rollup) for blockchain developers. It lets them choose from different virtual machines, like Sealevel, to build custom blockchains that benefit from the security of established networks like Ethereum and Polygon.</p>
<p>Last month, they launched the Sealevel virtual machine (SVM) Layer 2 <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/polygon-introduces-agglayer-aims-to-simplify-blockchain-integration-across-platforms.htm">blockchain for Polygon</a> to ease migration from Solana to Polygon.</p>
<p>This newly funded release will emulate the Polygon SVM but with a focus on Ethereum, leveraging a blend of modern technologies from established blockchains. The multi-layered blend will combine <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">Ethereum, Solana, Celestia, and RISC Zero elements</a>.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to achieve faster transaction speeds on Solana without compromising Ethereum&#8217;s security.</p>
<p>Regarding the potential impact on both ecosystems, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ex-terra-developer-raises-funds-for-this-new-project.htm">Neel Somani</a>, CEO of Eclipse Labs, stated that the solution will be a ‚Äúnet additive for both ecosystems.‚Äù</p>
<p>He emphasized this significance, stating that from an ETH perspective, the development is an important way for Ethereum to scale.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor Solana, we&#8217;re bringing more people into the Solana Virtual Machine,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>In December 2023, Eclipse launched the test net with the intention of prioritizing developers. Opening the mainnet to developers in the coming weeks gives them a platform to build applications that benefit from the project&#8217;s architecture.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Eclipse Testnet is live.</p>
<p>This marks a significant step towards bringing the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to Ethereum L2. <a href="https://t.co/4VAZh2W5A0">pic.twitter.com/4VAZh2W5A0</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Eclipse (@EclipseFND) <a href="https://twitter.com/EclipseFND/status/1734966671457329478?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>While a user-friendly bridge for regular cryptocurrency users may come later, this developer-centric approach is meant to be a foundation before wider adoption.</p>
<p>Eclipse Labs also prioritizes decentralization by planning to hand over control to its stakeholders gradually. This likely means a future shift towards a community-driven governance model.</p>
<p>The company has not yet publicized its specifics, but a potential token airdrop might be coming. This approach is similar to that decentralized projects adopt to facilitate community involvement.</p>
<h2>Building Bridges Between Ecosystems</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Eclipse Labs is essentially attempting to foster collaboration and interoperability between the Ethereum and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-february-2024-report-sol-price-analysis.htm">Solana ecosystems</a>. This approach allows applications built for Solana to run on Eclipse with minimal modifications.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/will-this-new-0-01-cryptocurrency-be-the-next-solana-sol.htm">SOL tokens</a> will remain the primary currency within the Eclipse ecosystem, further bridging the gap between the two major blockchain players.</p>
<p>While the initial launch caters to developers, the project has garnered interest from established players in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space.</p>
<p>Major Solana protocols like Solend have expressed their intent to deploy on Eclipse, highlighting its potential to streamline DeFi operations.</p>
<p>Rooter, the developer of Solend, expressed his enthusiasm about the potential benefits of deploying on Eclipse, stating that it was a good bet.</p>
<p>Like similar projects with exciting promises, its success lies in delivering on these promises of faster, secure, and interoperable transactions.</p>
<p>If successful, it could become a key player in bridging the gap between existing blockchains and fostering a more connected future for decentralized applications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Bitcoin (BTC) pushed towards $73,000 on Monday and Ether (ETH) above $4,000, the crypto market rally has broadened in favor of recent laggards, with the likes of XRP (XRP) and Litecoin (LTC) experiencing notable pumps&#8211;though these coins were far from the top crypto gainers today.</p>
<p>XRP rallied 16% and Litecoin 20% in the past 24 hours, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap data shows</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/ethereum/">Ether (ETH)</a>, meanwhile, were each up in the region of 4% over the same time period.</p>
<p>The market continues to derive strong support from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-aum-hits-10b-overtaking-the-ishares-silver-trust.htm">spot Bitcoin ETF inflows</a>, which come ahead of next month‚Äôs halving.</p>
<p>Ethereum is also set to undergo a major upgrade this week that should give a particular boost for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-layer-2-platforms-now-manage-over-36-7-billion-a-record-high.htm">layer-2 protocols</a>.</p>
<p>While the outlook for the broader market remains positive, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-low-cap-crypto.htm">crypto traders looking for quick gains continue to hunt low-cap coins</a>.</p>
<p>And the undoubtedly best, though also riskiest, place to find such coins is in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-shitcoins-buy/">on-chain shitcoin markets</a>.</p>
<p>On-chain markets refer to the market for assets (like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nft-news/">NFTs</a> or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-erc20-wallets.htm">ERC-20</a> tokens) that have been issued on another <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/blockchain-technology/">blockchain</a>.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/shiba-inu-price-prediction-as-shib-reaches-20-billion-market-cap-10-shib-possible.htm">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a> token lives on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token.</p>
<p>The thing with on-chain markets is that almost anyone can launch any coin at any time.</p>
<p>On-chain markets are thus a swamp of shitcoins, the majority of which are either <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/approval-phishing-scams-see-explosive-growth.htm">scams</a> or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ksi-faces-pump-and-dump-allegations-after-reopening-crypto-focused-x-account.htm">pump-and-dump schemes</a>.</p>
<p>Still, thanks to their low liquidity and tiny market caps, shitcoin markets are the only market where an investors can 10x (or more) their initial investment in under 24 hours.</p>
<p>Here are some of the top crypto gainers today in the shitcoin market that traders will be watching.</p>
<h2><strong>Top Crypto Gainers Today</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3><strong>OpClouds ($OPC)</strong></h3>
<p>A just-launched shitcoin called OpClouds ($OPC) which claims to be transforming <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-depin-coins/">decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN)</a> with decentralized computing resources as a service has seen a big 21,500% pump on its first day of trade, <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xc046b2e3542427d07f511a3a014cda9d471eda3a?t=1710193411969">as per DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>That has seen its market cap rise to $1.97 million, and liquidity reach $250,000.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs worth noting that liquidity is locked, reducing the risk of a rug pull.</p>
<p>But Quick Intel‚Äôs audit of its smart contract shows there is a hefty 20.9% sell tax.</p>
<p>Investors should always do their due diligence when investing in shitcoins.</p>
<h3><strong>HuskyInu ($HUSKY)</strong></h3>
<p>Husky-themed meme coin HuskyInu ($HUSKY) is up nearly 22,000% since launching on Monday, <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x4539044f1fbcb9b05d0f9105bf73981c7b30ce1c?t=1710193413700">as per DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>That has seen the token‚Äôs market cap rise to $876,000 and liquidity to around $270,000.</p>
<p>The token also has close to 300 holders, with $150,000 in volume having changed hands.</p>
<p>DEXTools‚Äô security audit reveals no concerning aspects to the token‚Äôs smart contract.</p>
<p>But that doesn‚Äôt mean the token isn&#8217;t a pump-and-dump scheme for sure.</p>
<p>Again, always do your own research before getting involved in shitcoin markets.</p>
<h3><strong>Tao Ceti ($CETI)</strong></h3>
<p>Another DePIN shitcoin called Tao Ceti ($CETI) has pumped over 4,500% on Monday, hitting a market cap near $11 million.</p>
<p>The shitcoin has nearly $2.7 million in liquidity and has seen volumes of $1.65 million since launch.</p>
<p>It has a 5% tax but, concerningly, this is modifiable.</p>
<p>Traders should thus be very cautious as the token‚Äôs issuer could easily jack this up to 100%.</p>
<p><strong>Alternatives to Consider ‚Äì Smog (SMOG)</strong></p>
<p>Shitcoins are highly risky. Most are either outright scams or, at the very least, pump-and-dump schemes designed to leave unsuspecting investors holding the bag.</p>
<p>A much better strategy is to look for more established meme coins that already have a presence but haven‚Äôt seen a massive pump just yet.</p>
<p>One such meme coin is a recently launched Solana coin called Smog (SMOG).</p>
<p>Its price has pumped nearly 8x since late February to reach a market cap of $270 million, <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/solana/pair-explorer/G6oNRyjP2WAVDUTYFPZsgBBxxMetyQEi2AYbmzRNe7Mc?t=1709910872407">as per¬†DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Smog Coin: Skyrocketing Past 30 Cents - Is $1 Just a Breath Away?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZSTm5z1ysuE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The dragon-themed token markets itself as offering Solana‚Äôs greatest airdrop of all time.</p>
<p>Traders can qualify for the airdrop by buying and holding SMOG on Solana, or staking the token on Ethereum.</p>
<p>Even though its market cap remains modest, SMOG already boasts a strong community.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="https://birdeye.so/token/FS66v5XYtJAFo14LiPz5HT93EUMAHmYipCfQhLpU4ss8?chain=solana">as per¬†birdeye.so</a>, it already has over 60,000 holders.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/solana-airdrops/">Given all the excitement about Solana airdrops in recent months</a>, SMOG could gain significant interest in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>SMOG could deliver at least 10x gains to investors, hence its rank in the best crypto meme coins to buy now.</p>
<p>Traders should note that they can clinch a 10% discount when buying SMOG directly through the project‚Äôs website.</p>
<p>They can also stake their tokens for a 42% APY.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:350">The developer of the BRC-20 token standard, known as Domo, revealed a shift in the token&#8217;s governance on Monday. The creator&#8217;s non-profit, the Layer 1 Foundation (L1F), will now oversee the protocol&#8217;s token management.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:350">Domo announced that <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/11/brc-20-creator-domo-addresses-thorny-governance-issues-with-new-lead-maintainer-appointments/">L1F will collaborate with UniSat and Best in Slot</a>, key Bitcoin infrastructure providers, to serve as BRC-20&#8217;s lead maintainers.</p>

<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:267">BRC-20 operates on the Bitcoin network&#8217;s Ordinals Protocol, enabling the movement of non-BTC digital assets. The technology utilizes &#8220;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-nft-sales-drops-80-bybit-introduces-marketplace-for-bitcoin-and-evm-inscriptions-more-top-nft-news.htm">inscriptions</a>&#8221; on satoshis, which are small units of BTC, to track, store data, and facilitate asset transfers on the Bitcoin Network.</p>
<h2 data-sourcepos="9:1-9:33">BRC-20 Partnerships and Advancements</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:379">Governance for both the protocol and within the broader Bitcoin network has <a href="https://stanford-jblp.pubpub.org/pub/bitcoin-governance">historically been a complex issue</a>.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:379">This was evident earlier in the year with a disagreement between Domo and UniSat, an Ordinals Protocol marketplace. <a href="https://unisat-wallet.medium.com/2024-01-the-story-of-unisats-indexer-e33053f905ae">UniSat supported a protocol upgrade for Ordinals</a> known as &#8220;Jubilee&#8221; which Domo opposed, stating it had the potential to divide the growing environment.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:296">Despite this past conflict, Domo recognized UniSat&#8217;s crucial early role in decentralizing the BRC-20 ecosystem.</p>
<h2 data-sourcepos="19:1-19:31"><strong>Oversight and Future Growth</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:296">UniSat was the first marketplace to list BRC-20 tokens and collaboration between UniSat and Best in Slot resulted in the creation of a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/5-crypto-index-tokens-that-allow-you-buy-market.htm">decentralized indexing</a> product for BRC-20.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:254">&#8220;The goal is to support the growth of Bitcoin metaprotocols on Ordinals and beyond,&#8221; Domo stated. &#8220;BRC-20 was an early experiment‚Äîbut we‚Äôre seeing a wave of standards that need tools, infrastructure, and support to thrive.&#8221;</p>
<p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:309">To support the BRC-20 standard&#8217;s governance framework, Domo created an oversight committee, which includes the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-billionaire-arthur-hayes-and-brc-20-creator-domo-invest-in-bitcoin-ordinals-wallet-oyls-3m-raise.htm">Bitcoin Ordinals wallet</a>, Oyl (which recently completed a pre-seed funding round with Domo&#8217;s investment), and UXTO Management, part of Bitcoin Magazine&#8217;s parent company, BTC Inc.</p>

<p>He also stressed that using the blockchain guarantees that information is unaltered and makes it traceable for the different parties.</p>
<p>For example, technology may make it easier for international parties to share sensitive forensic data safely.</p>

<p>The adoption of blockchain technology by the UAE&#8217;s law enforcement has the potential to set a global precedent for other countries seeking to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-enhance-crypto-security-in-2024.htm">enhance their security</a> infrastructure through advanced solutions as well.</p>
<h2>The Potential of Blockchain in Law Enforcement</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Blockchain technology holds immense potential to introduce unique and effective law enforcement practices, offering novel solutions to address contemporary criminal investigations and security challenges.</p>
<p>Proactive law enforcement worldwide uses blockchain technology to track criminals and their activities. It has shown huge potential and effectiveness in addressing money laundering, terrorism financing, and more.</p>
<p>Law enforcement organizations also have great potential to deploy blockchain analytics solutions to manage investigative data, policymaking, and compliance.</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/china-warms-up-to-blockchain-technology-1329.htm">China leverages blockchain technology</a> to generate tamper-proof data to ensure the security of judicial data.</p>
<p>Additionally, blockchain analytics can be deployed to manage investigative data, formulate policies, and ensure compliance.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>xAI CEO Elon Musk is making ChatGPT competitor Grok open-source. His decision comes after Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, a company he co-founded, for allegedly abandoning its original non-profit mission.</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s intention to open-source Grok was <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1752098683024220632">announced on a March 11 X post</a>. This move aligns with Musk&#8217;s long-standing advocacy for responsible AI development, as demonstrated by his call for a &#8220;third-party referee&#8221; in AI development at the UK&#8217;s AI Safety Summit in 2023.</p>
<h2>xAI&#8217;s Grok and Musk&#8217;s Vision</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Elon Musk&#8217;s departure from OpenAI due to disagreements over the organization&#8217;s direction and strategy led him to launch xAI. The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hundreds-of-grok-tokens-launched-days-after-elon-musk-backed-chatgpt-rival-goes-live.htm">launch of Grok in November 2023</a> further highlighted Musk&#8217;s commitment to open-source and non-profit AI initiatives.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first human received an implant from <a href="https://twitter.com/neuralink?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Neuralink</a> yesterday and is recovering well.</p>
<p>Initial results show promising neuron spike detection.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1752098683024220632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 29, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN3KPFbWCy8">November podcast with Lex Fridman</a>, Musk criticized OpenAI&#8217;s transition from a non-profit, open-source initiative to a profit-driven, closed-source model.</p>
<p>Specifically, Musk is recognized for his opposition to large tech companies profiting from AI development, frequently highlighting concerns about the ethical implications of such practices.</p>
<p>Open-sourcing Grok will align xAI with companies like France&#8217;s Mistral, which advocates for open access to AI models.</p>
<p>This approach allows developers to collaborate and accelerate improvements.</p>
<p>Regardless, tech investors are divided on open-sourcing AI, particularly in light of Musk&#8217;s lawsuit. While some see it as a catalyst for innovation, others are worried about potential misuse.</p>
<h2>Musk&#8217;s Legal Battle with OpenAI</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Recently, Musk <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/worldcoin-price-dips-as-elon-musk-sues-openai-and-sam-altman.htm">filed a lawsuit</a> against OpenAI, claiming it breached the agreement made when OpenAI was founded as a non-profit organization.</p>
<p>He argued that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/worldcoins-wld-gains-6-as-sam-altman-joins-microsoft-to-lead-its-new-ai-research-team.htm">OpenAI&#8217;s partnership with Microsoft</a>, reportedly worth nearly $3 billion by 2023, contradicted its original mission of advancing open-source AI for the benefit of humanity.</p>
<p>The lawsuit urged OpenAI to return to its open-source principles and prevent the for-profit exploitation of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) technology.</p>
<p>In response to the accusations, OpenAI released emails suggesting that Musk had previously agreed to transform the AI company into a for-profit entity. This revelation came a few months after CEO Sam Altman was reinstated to the board following his <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sam-altmans-departure-from-openai-triggers-a-sharp-decline-in-worldcoins-value-whats-going-on.htm">five-day dismissal</a> in November 2023.</p>
<p>Grok is an AI chatbot similar to OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT, but can access real-time information through X and tackle sensitive topics that other AI systems might avoid.</p>
<p>The Grok-1 large language model powers it, and while it is more advanced than GPT-3.5, <a href="https://generativeai.pub/grok-vs-chatgpt-4-a-comprehensive-comparison-dc97ca54f754">Grok reportedly falls short of OpenAI&#8217;s latest GPT-4</a> model in overall performance.</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s announcement on X has seen mostly positive responses, with many users praising his commitment to open-source AI.</p>
<p>One user on X suggested, &#8220;OpenAI should do the same. If they are &#8216;open,&#8217; that is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1767110461772706062?s=20">responded by stating</a>, &#8220;OpenAI is a lie.‚Äù</p>

<p>With BlackRock&#8217;s IBIT <a href="https://twitter.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1766359858893262958">amassing 197,943 BTC</a>, valued at over $13.5 billion, the narrative around Bitcoin and its investment allure is undergoing a remarkable transformation.</p>
<p>This shift comes on the heels of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s approval of nine new funds, highlighting the escalating institutional demand propelling Bitcoin&#8217;s value.</p>
<p>As Bitcoin&#8217;s price breached the $72,000 threshold, the spotlight intensifies on the potential trajectory of this leading cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2><strong>BlackRock&#8217;s Spot ETF Holdings Outshine MicroStrategy</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
BlackRock&#8217;s leap into the forefront with its spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-27.htm">Bitcoin ETF holdings</a> surpassing those of MicroStrategy signifies a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency domain.</p>
<p>This development is not just a milestone for BlackRock but signals a broader trend of growing institutional investment in Bitcoin, potentially reshaping market dynamics and price predictions.</p>
<p>With ETFs excluding Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC now holding assets exceeding $28 billion, institutional interest is undeniably a driving force behind Bitcoin&#8217;s ascent.</p>

<p>Amidst this institutional rally, MicroStrategy continues to fortify its Bitcoin strategy, with plans to raise over $600 million to augment its Bitcoin reserves.</p>
<p>This aggressive accumulation strategy, paired with CEO Michael Saylor&#8217;s steadfast belief in Bitcoin&#8217;s supremacy over traditional assets, underscores a deepening conviction among corporate entities in Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term value.</p>
<p>As institutional players like BlackRock and MicroStrategy jostle for dominance in the Bitcoin space, the question looms: Are institutional investors here to stay, and what does this mean for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction.htm">Bitcoin&#8217;s price prediction</a> and the future of cryptocurrency investment?</p>
<h2 class="c-message_attachment">Bitcoin Price Update</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin&#8217;s market presence remains formidable, with its price today hitting $72,500, showcasing a notable 4.50% increase over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>This surge brings its <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">market capitalization</a> to a staggering $1.425 trillion, securing its top position in the cryptocurrency arena.</p>
<p>Currently, Bitcoin&#8217;s circulating supply is at 19,651,543 BTC, edging closer to its 21 million max supply limit.</p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
From a technical standpoint, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC/USD)</a>&#8216;s pivot point holds at around $70,013 serves as a foundation for its current trajectory.</p>
<p>Resistance levels are identified at $73,824, $76,749, and $79,904, each marking potential hurdles for upward movement. Conversely, support levels at $67,154, $64,861, and $62,192 provide cushions against declines.</p>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 72, indicating potential overbought conditions, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displays a value of 174 with a signal line at 1177, suggesting a bullish momentum as the MACD line overtakes the signal line.</p>

<p>Notably, Bitcoin&#8217;s breakthrough above the $70,000 threshold and the emergence of bullish engulfing candlesticks signal a potent uptrend, with potential targets at $73,800 or higher.</p>
<p>The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $66,860 underpins this bullish sentiment, offering additional support to Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the overall trend for Bitcoin appears bullish above the $72,200 mark.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump took to CNBC on Monday to reveal he was unsure whether he would want to get rid of Bitcoin despite criticizing it in the past, going so far as to say he has ‚Äúfun‚Äù with the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere has been a lot of use of that (bitcoin) and I‚Äôm not sure that I would want to take it away at this point,‚Äù Trump said during his appearance on CNBC&#8217;s Squawk Box.</p>
<h2>Trump is Bullish About Bitcoin</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs taken [on] its own life,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúYou know, I do little things for fun with it and you know make money with it<b>‚Äî</b>and have fun with it, too.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trump now sounds bullish on Bitcoin. Personally, I don‚Äôt believe him. He and his administration had a shot for supporting Bitcoin. It was hard if not a full stone wall to work with them.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The leading GOP candidate‚Äôs praise for Bitcoin marks a shift in his <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/trump-calls-cbdc-a-very-dangerous-thing-criticizes-artificial-intelligence.htm">stance towards cryptocurrencies</a> in general, having previously called them ‚Äúhighly volatile‚Äù and ‚Äúbased on thin air.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúSometimes, we‚Äôll let people pay with Bitcoin,‚Äù Trump said about the recently released <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/absolutely-everything-we-know-about-the-trump-sneakers.html">American-themed sneaker line</a>. ‚ÄúIf you think of it, it&#8217;s an additional form of currency.‚Äù</p>
<h2>Trump Doubles Down On USD Stance</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The former president has previously expressed disdain for cryptocurrencies being used instead of the United States dollar, referring to himself as ‚Äúnot a fan‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable,‚Äù Trump stated in 2019. ‚ÄúIt is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way.‚Äù</p>
<p>During his Monday appearance on Squawk Box, Trump doubled down on his USD-first position, stating replacing USD would be ‚Äúa hit‚Äù to the country.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI hate when countries go off the dollar,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúI would not allow countries to go off the dollar because when we lose that standard that will be like losing a revolutionary war.‚Äù</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s Rally Continues As Price Surges Above $72,000</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Trump‚Äôs comments come amid a feverish rally for Bitcoin, with its <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">price surging above $72,000</a> on Monday morning.</p>
<p>Bitcoin‚Äôs latest rally follows the United States Security and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) January 2024 approval of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/a-beginner-s-guide-to-bitcoin-etfs.htm">nine spot bitcoin ETFs</a> in a move that many feel will signal greater mainstream adoption of the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>As of last week, spot bitcoin ETFs had reached <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/281339/bitcoin-etf-supply-4-percent">cumulative net inflows of over $9.37 billion</a> since their regulatory debut.</p>
<p>Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas took to X Monday morning to call the rapid growth of spot bitcoin ETFs ‚Äúsimply absurd.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">First two months officially in the books (it&#39;s felt like six) and the ten bitcoin ETFs now have over $55b in assets with exactly double that in volume at $110b. If these were the numbers at the end of year I&#39;d call them a success. To do it in eight weeks is simply absurd. <a href="https://t.co/8YvzQZdYyJ">pic.twitter.com/8YvzQZdYyJ</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1767156517449400449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 11, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/is-it-too-late-to-buy-bitcoin/">bitcoin&#8217;s price may continue to skyrocket</a> in advance of its quadrennial halving event expected in April 2024.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto friendly American asset manager Ark Invest sees Bitcoin&#8217;s price hitting $1 million before 2030, according to CEO Cathie Wood in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDrdpl6epzw">interview</a> with the New Zealand Herald.</p>
<p>Hard-talking Bitcoin maxi Wood already eyed a projection of $1.5 million earlier this year in an interview with CNBC. At the time, Wood said a &#8220;bear case&#8221; would still result in a price rise to around¬† $258,500.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cathie Wood makes her $1.5 million bull case for the price of bitcoin by 2030. <a href="https://t.co/r34iRNA9bG">https://t.co/r34iRNA9bG</a> <a href="https://t.co/chWWDH7ioE">pic.twitter.com/chWWDH7ioE</a></p>
<p>&mdash; CNBC (@CNBC) <a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1745479111881920808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Wood gave that estimate on January 11, 2024, the day the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) to begin trading.</p>
<p>Wood&#8217;s previous projections had eyed $1 million as a Bitcoin&#8217;s price target and it&#8217;s looking like she has returned to this position.</p>
<p>Still, in her latest interview, Wood implied that $1 million by 2030 might even be a conservative estimate.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat target ‚Äî it was before the SEC gave us the green light, and I think that was a major milestone, and it has pulled forward the timeline,‚Äù she explained.</p>
<p>She then named Morgan Stanley, Merryl Lynch and Bank of America as financial heavyweights that haven&#8217;t yet started dealing with Bitcoin, implying that it&#8217;s only a matter of time before they join the gravy train: ‚ÄúNo platform has approved Bitcoin yet, so all of this price action has happened before they approve it, and so we haven‚Äôt even begun,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur target is above that; it‚Äôs well above that,&#8221; she teased, declining to give a figure but stating that &#8220;with our new expectations for institutional involvement, the incremental price that we assume for institutions actually has more than doubled.‚Äù</p>
<h2>Bitcoin at $1 Million This Year?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Considering Cathie Wood helms one of the most crypto-bullish asset managers, and given that Ark Invest already has a spot Bitcoin ETF on exchanges and is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-ethereum-etf-approval-expected-may-23rd-and-could-surge-in-value-new-report-says.htm">eyeing up</a> a spot Ethereum ETF too, it&#8217;s fair to say she has a pro-crypto bias.</p>
<p>In spite of that, Bitcoin is currently trading at a new all-time high and it looks like there is plenty more mileage left for a potential 2024 bull run.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because two potentially pivotal price-driving events are coming up. One on April 19, and the other on May 23.</p>
<p>In April is the quadrennial Bitcoin halving. The halving is a pre-determined event in Bitcoin&#8217;s code that cuts miners&#8217; rewards in half leading to a supply squeeze in the issuance of new Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Historically, this has driven rallies.</p>
<p>Then in May, the SEC is expected to give a verdict on VanEck&#8217;s application for a US spot Ethereum ETF. Based on historic precedent with Bitcoin, several analysts, including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-ethereum-etf-approval-expected-may-23rd-and-could-surge-in-value-new-report-says.htm">Standard Chartered</a>, say that the SEC is likely to approve a round of applications on this date.</p>
<p>The approval of Ethereum ETFs almost looks like a foregone conclusion since Bitcoin ETFs started trading. If the SEC were to reject them, applicants may appeal and win, as Grayscale did with its Bitcoin ETF last year.</p>
<p>Given that Ethereum is crypto&#8217;s most commercially important blockchain, ETFs off the back of Bitcoin&#8217;s halving could drive all leading cryptocurrencies to new heights.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>According to MicroStrategy&#8217;s official <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-completes-800-million-offering-of-0625-convertible-senior-notes-due-2030_03-11-2024">press release</a>, the cloud software company sold the unsecured bonds, which will mature in 2030, to institutional buyers on March 8 this year at a rate of 0.625%.</p>
<p>The sale of the notes generated¬†approximately $782.0 million, after deductions. The company also confirmed that it used the net proceeds &#8220;to obtain additional bitcoins.‚Äù</p>
<p class="Paragraph_text-SqIsdNjh0t0- paywall" data-component="paragraph">It also ‚Äúexpects to grant to the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued, up to an additional $90 million aggregate principal amount of the notes,‚Äù the company said.</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">MicroStrategy shares rallied sharply today. They&#8217;re currently up 13% to $1,550. Since MicroStrategy made buying Bitcoin part of its corporate strategy, many have viewed MicroStrategy shares as a proxy for Bitcoin, since the two tend to rise in tandem.</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">MicroStrategy is easily the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin.</p>
<h2 data-component="paragraph">Bitcoin Trades at an All-Time High</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin maxis are happy <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-27.htm">today</a> as the world&#8217;s favorite cryptocurrency trades at an all-time high of around $72,000. The last time the industry looked this healthy was back in late 2021, when Bitcoin set a former ATH of around $69,000.</p>
<p>The fever pitch around Bitcoin is really concentrated on two overarching narratives that are really helping to drive prices: ETFs and the halving.</p>
<p>See Bitcoin is popular, but it&#8217;s also very volatile and unregulated. Naturally, for investors in more traditional financial products, it can seem like a risky prospect.</p>
<p>Enter exchange-traded funds (ETFs). An ETF is essentially a Bitcoin fund, meaning it&#8217;s an entity that directly buys and stores Bitcoin and uses the asset to create shares, which it then sells on exchanges.</p>
<p>These shares track the price of the underlying asset, but thanks to their regulated status, they have more guardrails to help build confidence in crypto among investors from traditional finance backgrounds.</p>
<p>Many crypto advocates had been pining for a Bitcoin ETF for the last decade. The oldest and most senior Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale, started with an eye to eventually converting to an ETF but the SEC knocked it back last year.</p>
<p>Grayscale took the SEC&#8217;s rejection to an appeals court, where a judge ruled in Grayscale&#8217;s favor, calling the rejection &#8220;arbitrary and capricious&#8221;.</p>
<p>The move forced the SEC to approve eleven spot Bitcoin ETF applications earlier this year. They&#8217;ve already been some of the most hyped and successful ETF launches in history.</p>
<h2>And the Halving&#8230;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Finally, the market is also looking towards Bitcoin&#8217;s upcoming halving on April 19 to potentially drive prices beyond $100,000.</p>
<p>On that date, Bitcoin mining block rewards get cut in half, thus &#8220;halving&#8221; the issuance of new Bitcoin. If the current demand for Bitcoin sustains itself till then, the laws of supply and demand could catalyze some very roomy price rises.</p>
<p>It looks like billionaire Saylor believes there&#8217;s a lot more rally left.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the participants of The Legacy Cowls Collection experience will also have the opportunity to shape the next chapter.</p>
<h1><b>Sony Eyes ‚ÄòSuper-Fungible Tokens‚Äô for Gaming</b></h1>
<p>Japanese conglomerate Sony has recently submitted a patent application discussing super-fungible tokens for gaming.</p>
<p>The application <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/20240066408">includes</a> an electronic device and a method for the implementation of these tokens.</p>
<p>The device, it said, tracks a set of gaming assets associated with a player in a gaming application.¬†Examples of assets include an avatar, tools, or a weapon.</p>
<p>Gaming applications could be sports, fighting, athletics, etc.</p>
<p>The device would receive the metadata and create a super-fungible token corresponding to one gaming asset.</p>
<p>The super-fungible token contains a set of non-fungible tokens, wherein each NFT is associated with a corresponding in-game asset.</p>
<p>The super-fungible token itself would be recorded on a distributed ledger connected to that specific gaming app.</p>
<p>For example, said the document, that distributed ledger ‚Äúmay be an <b>Ethereum</b> blockchain which may use accounts as state objects and a state of each account can be tracked by the Ethereum blockchain. [‚Ä¶] The distributed ledger may correspond to a <b>Hyperledger</b> blockchain, or a <b>Corda</b> blockchain.‚Äù</p>
<figure id="attachment_181046" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181046" style="width: 1159px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-181046 size-full" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/11162402/1710174242-sony.png" alt="" width="1159" height="825" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/11162402/1710174242-sony.png 1159w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/11162402/1710174242-sony-300x214.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/11162402/1710174242-sony-1024x729.png 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/11162402/1710174242-sony-768x547.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/11162402/1710174242-sony-150x107.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1159px) 100vw, 1159px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-181046" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Sony</figcaption></figure>
<p>The invention would be transformative for the gaming industry, it argues, as it may potentially allow inter-game transfers.</p>
<p>The proposed system would track these gaming assets as they move between game titles.</p>
<p>Moreover, when one NFT is selected, that becomes the active gaming asset, and the others are disabled.</p>
<p>This would theoretically give more control to players over their own assets.</p>
<p>The patent application was filed in August 2022 and published on February 29, 2024.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Core Foundation, which aims to create a secure and decentralized ecosystem for dApps, is launching a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/nft/">non-fungible token</a> (NFT) marketplace.</p>

<p>The announcement comes days after the foundation launched a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/this-new-5m-fund-aims-to-scale-bitcoin-aligned-projects-in-india-heres-the-latest.htm">$5 million innovation fund</a> to promote India‚Äôs Web3 communities.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum (ETH) is back trading comfortably above $4,000, a level last seen in late 2021.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency underpinning the most commercially important blockchain rallied 14.3% over the last 7 days, outpacing market leader Bitcoin (BTC), which rallied 9.7% this week.</p>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s market cap now hovers at close to half a trillion, although it will need to effectively triple that to catch up with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Despite Ethereum&#8217;s stronger rally, today is really Bitcoin&#8217;s day, as the world&#8217;s oldest and most popular cryptocurrency is currently changing hands at an all-time high (ATH) of almost $72,000.</p>
<p>While Ethereum&#8217;s smart contracts quickly expanded the horizon of what blockchain was capable of and helped to usher in an alternative financial system, it&#8217;s really Bitcoin that bootstraps the entire market.</p>
<h2>Crypto in the Coming Months</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
There is a lot to look forward to in the near term from both of the market leaders.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is trading at a new ATH off the back of new institutional interest since the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>The ETFs have together attracted nearly $10 billion in inflows since they began trading on January 11.</p>
<p>Bitcoiners are also pointing at the quadrennial halving on April 19 as another price driver. The halving is when miners&#8217; block rewards get halved, causing a supply squeeze in the issuance of new Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Historically, halvings have tended to drive the price higher, and this halving looks no different, with institutional demand for Bitcoin currently at an all-time high.</p>
<p>Ethereum fans are also pointing at a potential milestone on May 23. This is the SEC&#8217;s first deadline to return a verdict on the latest round of applications for a spot Ethereum ETF. If Ethereum ETFs are approved, then institutional demand for Ethereum in the US could drive prices to new highs.</p>
<p>Over on the price chart we can see that Ethereum has charted a clear path upwards since the start of February, although with a current Relative Strength Index (RSI) almost at 70, there is heavy buying pressure.</p>

<h2>Ethereum is Great But SPONGE Is Funnier</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Ethereum and Bitcoin may be where the safe money is at, but a small group of coins posted blistering triple-digit percentage seven-day gains recently: meme coins.</p>
<p>Viral marketing campaigns and the novelty factor typically drive meme coin prices, although two of the largest are now serious projects in the industry: Dogecoin (DOGE), which has a first-mover advantage and originality on its side, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) on Solana is branching out as a network and offering more utility,</p>
<p>One meme token that combines freshness with utility and offers more than laughs is SPONGE. it‚Äôs the native token for an exciting new ecosystem.</p>

<p>As Bitcoin (BTC) pushes into the $72,000s for the first time ever and Ether (ETH) rallies to the north of $4,000, crypto investors are assessing which might be the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<p>Strong <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrocks-global-allocation-fund-to-invest-in-spot-bitcoin-etfs.htm">spot Bitcoin ETF</a> demand ahead the supply shock of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/bitcoin-halving/">Bitcoin halving</a> has propelled Bitcoin higher in recent weeks.</p>
<p>This has bled across to other sectors of the crypto market, with major <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coins</a> outperforming notably in recent weeks.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> looks to be on course to hit $100,000 in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>Some are even betting it could reach six digits before the April halving.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">Ether</a>, meanwhile, looks to be on course to soon clinch new record highs.</p>
<p>With the outlook for both cryptocurrencies looking very strong, both BTC and ETH are integral to any crypto investor‚Äôs portfolio.</p>
<p>But with BTC and ETH‚Äôs potential gains in the 2-3x range, highly risk-tolerant crypto investors often crave greater upside exposure.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why they often turn to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/altcoin-news/">altcoin</a> markets to hunt for lesser-known but high-potential cryptos.</p>
<p>Here are some of Monday‚Äôs best-performing altcoins, each of which could be the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Crypto to Buy Today</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3><strong>Theta Network (THETA)</strong></h3>
<p>Novel ‚Äúdual network‚Äù¬†<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/theta/">Theta Network</a>¬†is one of the best-performing cryptos on Monday,¬†<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/theta-network/">up 25% in 24 hours</a>.</p>
<p>THETA‚Äôs price pumped to as high as $ 3.80 earlier, its highest since April 2022.</p>
<p>It has since retraced to around $3.65 per token.</p>
<p>But since pushing above $2.30 resistance, there is a clear path to resistance at $4.50.</p>
<p>Theta Network combines a¬†<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart-contract</a>-enabled layer-1 blockchain with a data and storage network.</p>
<p>With a market cap of only around $3.6 billion, THETA has plenty of upside left for this bull market.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why THETA could be the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h3><strong>Floki (FLOKI)</strong></h3>
<p>FLOKI (FLOKI), the Shiba Inu meme coin that was created in honor of Elon Musk‚Äôs pet Shiba Inu dog, is a leading coin on Monday.</p>
<p>As per¬†<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/floki-inu/">CoinMarketCap</a>, it was last up 21% in 24 hours, with its market cap surpassing $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>But with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu both valued above $20 billion, it could have a long way higher to run.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why, despite having already pumped a long way, it could be the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h3><strong>NEAR Protocol (NEAR)</strong></h3>
<p>Layer-1 protocol NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is up around 20% in the past 24 hours, as per¬†<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/near-protocol/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>Last just above $7.0, NEAR recently hit its highest-ever levels.</p>
<p>Amid a lack of notable upside resistance levels, the sky is now the limit for NEAR.</p>
<p>With a market cap of currently only slightly above $7 billion, if it continues to garner widespread adoption, NEAR Protocol has the potential to still rally 5-10x from here.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why NEAR could be best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
All of the above coins offer potential investors a great chance to make 10x gains.</p>
<p>But, for those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in¬†<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 14 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mudrex, an Indian cryptocurrency investment platform, has announced plans to offer US spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to institutional and retail investors in India, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/03/11/indian-crypto-investment-platform-mudrex-to-offer-us-bitcoin-etfs-to-indian-investors/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;utm_campaign=headlines">said</a> CEO and co-founder Edul Patel in a recent interview.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Patel emphasized the significance of this move for institutions, granting them access to spot bitcoin ETFs, previously only accessible to retail investors via US stock investing firms.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Indian Investors Can Invest in US Spot Bitcoin ETFs</span></strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Investment platform Mudrex will be the first to offer this service to institutions in India. Within the first phase of its offering, Mudrex will list the top four BTC ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, Vanguard, and Franklin Templeton.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Committed to full compliance with Indian regulatory frameworks, Mudrex is registered with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of India, ensuring adherence to stringent legal standards. The platform empowers users with access to a diverse array of over 350 cryptocurrencies and crypto baskets, augmented by actionable insights to guide investment decisions effectively.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Edul Patel, CEO and co-founder of Mudrex, emphasized the platform&#8217;s pioneering status in offering this service to Indian investors. In an interview, Patel highlighted the significance of Mudrex&#8217;s robust banking relationships, enabling seamless transactions for users navigating the complexities of the LRS process.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;This is much more valuable to institutions, as this was already available to retailers,&#8221; Patel said, highlighting the strategic significance of the move. While retail clients in India had limited access to spot Bitcoin ETFs through US stock investing companies, Mudrex aims to pioneer this service for institutional investors in the country.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">‚ÄúWe are certainly the first Indian crypto platform to offer this service. The LRS is the tricky part for most people, and over there (in the US), because we also have strong banking relationships, we‚Äôre able to help users do these transactions in a very seamless way, and that‚Äôs why these services are important.‚Äù</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mudrex, headquartered in California and backed by Y-Combinator, operates with a subsidiary registered with the Intelligence Unit of India. Additionally, it holds licenses in Lithuania and Italy within the European Union.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mudrex Facilitates Indian Investors&#8217; Access to Crypto ETFs Through the Liberalized Remittance Scheme</span></strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Indian investors seeking exposure to crypto ETFs can leverage two avenues: domestic exchanges or the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS), with the latter incurring a 20% tax collected at source (TCS) on remittances. Mudrex intends to leverage the LRS route to facilitate seamless access to spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-already-tops-silver-in-u-s-etf-market-after-sec-approvals.htm">Bitcoin</a> ETFs for its clientele.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Patel explained the operational structure, indicating that Mudrex would ensure the processing of actual transactions through broker partners in the US. At the same time, its Indian subsidiary would facilitate the spot Bitcoin ETF service.¬†</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This development comes amidst a complex regulatory landscape in India, where the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Finance Ministry hold divergent views on cryptocurrency.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/rbi-governor-warns-of-crypto-risks-to-emerging-markets.htm">the RBI has expressed skepticism towards crypto</a>, the Finance Ministry&#8217;s Intelligence Unit has registered numerous Indian crypto service providers and imposed stringent taxes on the sector. While the two agree on the need to protect the Indian economy and investors, their regulatory focus can appear to differ.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Patel elucidated the regulatory framework surrounding the venture, highlighting the compatibility of bitcoin spot ETFs with the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS), which </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/save/rbi-liberalised-remittance-scheme-how-indians-can-use-lrs-to-invest-remit-money-abroad/articleshow/94365344.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">simplifies overseas investments for Indians</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. Mudrex will enable investments in spot bitcoin ETFs on its platform, with a minimum investment threshold of $5,000 and a maximum limit of $250,000, aligning with the RBI&#8217;s prescribed annual LRS limit.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Among Mudrex&#8217;s clientele of 350 institutions, Patel revealed that approximately 20 have initiated the process of joining the platform for spot BTC ETF investments, with an anticipated average ticket size of $110,000.¬†</span></p>
