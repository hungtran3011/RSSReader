<p>The Lunc crypto&#8217;s total value locked (TVL), which is the staked or locked value on the chain, has been surging since February of 2024. The rise in TVL in Terra classic crypto over time reflects the changing dynamics of market participation, the increase in the demand for the LUNC project, and the increase in investors’ willingness to stay invested.</p>



<p>According to recent reports, when the total value locked (TVL) in the Defilama platform increased, it had a positive impact on the confidence in LUNC. This increase in TVL also led to an increase in the liquidity, popularity, and usability of Terra Classic. Essentially, a higher TVL makes LUNC a more reliable and less risky asset. As per Defilama, the total TVL is currently $4.64 Million.</p>

<p>With its presale almost sold out, Memeinator has already raised significant funds, amassing over $6.2m, quickly advancing through its presale stages. This surge in interest isn&#8217;t just about joining another investment trend; it&#8217;s about being part of a project poised for explosive growth as American investors bet on Memeinator’s potential.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Memeinator stands out as the future’s brightest bet: Here’s why</strong></h2>



<p>In the current crypto boom, where Bitcoin and meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are hitting new highs, a new meme coin is rising as the future&#8217;s most promising investment &#8211; Memeinator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Memeinator emerges as not just another useless meme coin but a visionary project with the goal of reaching a $1 billion market cap. It sets itself apart with a compelling narrative, positioning itself as a meme coin from the future that’s here to obliterate all inferior meme coins, thereby reshaping the landscape.</p>



<p>Bullish sentiment is fueled by its crypto community, eagerly awaiting the <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/01/31/spot-ethereum-etf-is-expected-to-get-approved-before-may-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum ETF</a> decision as a pivotal moment promising to inject further vitality into the market. This anticipation bodes well for markets in general and Memeinator&#8217;s ascent in particular.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Introducing Memeinator: The game-changer in meme coin evolution</strong></h3>



<p>Memeinator boasts a strong narrative imbued with ‘90s nostalgia and a vital mission to eliminate subpar meme coins. Through its game, Meme Warfare, players battle inferior coins, symbolically eradicating them. This innovative approach aims to improve the meme coin ecosystem and offers an engaging experience for its community, aligning with the growing GameFi industry trend​.</p>



<p>Adding to the excitement is its unique Memescanner, which was completed in February. Leveraging community support and sophisticated AI, <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/03/11/memeinators-game-development-underway-american-investors-rush-to-invest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Memescanner</a> will track and tally inferior meme coins suggested by the Memeinator’s community in social media competitions, choosing the most hated meme coins from the list. These lesser coins are then integrated into the gameplay as challengers, offering gamers a unique opportunity to battle and triumph over them. This ingenious fusion of real-time data and interactive play offers an unparalleled gaming experience, ensuring only the cream of the crop prevails.</p>



<p>The creation of Memescanner was a collaborative effort between Memeinator and Red Apple Tech, a titan in the mobile app and gaming industry known for its pioneering work in blockchain, the Metaverse, AR, &amp; VR technologies. With a legacy spanning over a decade, Red Apple Tech has made its mark globally.</p>



<p>Insights from the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGrNvnkFlk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> latest AMA with Dylan and Marco</a>, Memeinator’s core team members, highlight these aspects of Memeinator&#8217;s direction and its commitment to redefining the meme coin market.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MMTR: Powering the future of meme coins</strong></h3>



<p>At the center of Memeinator&#8217;s ecosystem lies the MMTR token, a crucial element that fuels the platform&#8217;s dynamic activities. With a thoughtfully structured tokenomics model, MMTR facilitates a thriving community of engaged users. The token’s strategic distribution and staking options underscore Memeinator&#8217;s foresight in creating a robust, sustainable ecosystem.</p>



<p>In addition, Memeinator is embracing a deflationary <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/03/10/doge-shib-surge-while-furrever-token-furrs-initial-presale-achieves-record-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">token</a> model. This economic framework ensures the token&#8217;s value is primed for growth, making it an enticing proposition for investors looking beyond the immediate horizon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Memeinator doesn&#8217;t stop there. Its ecosystem is enriched with the upcoming integration of NFTs, offering depth, utility, and a diversified portfolio of opportunities that traditional meme coins simply can&#8217;t match.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>As the next crypto boom dawns, MMTR leads the charge</strong></h3>



<p>Amidst the current crypto boom and with meme coins setting new records, the Memeinator project stands on the brink of monumental success. Its growing die-hard community, which is already 135K strong <a href="https://twitter.com/TheMemeinator__" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on X </a>and has over 22K members in its Telegram group, is ready to ride Memeinator to the moon when it hits exchanges in Q1 of 2024.<br><br>Additionally, the likely Ethereum ETF approval paints an optimistic backdrop for Memeinator&#8217;s bold future, positioning it at the forefront of a potential crypto boom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This rally, far from being a spectacle of a select few, has been unfolding across an array of networks, including Solana (SOL, more than 521% increase this year) and Ethereum (ETH, more than 135% increase this year), enforcing the data behind the crypto community&#8217;s stern embrace of meme coins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, according to Cryptobubbles, tokens such as BONK and Dogwifhat (WIF) are currently riding the top of this wave, with BONK delivering an astonishing 5,500%+ gain this year. At the same time, WIF increased by over 500% this month alone, amplifying the excitement around the meme coin phenomenon.</p>



<p>This backdrop not only elevates meme coins like Memeinator but also marks them as jewels in the hunt for promising projects within this optimistic market climate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a rapid presale sellout and a Q1 listing on the horizon, a staggering 50x to 100x growth for MMTR is more than likely, especially given the success of rival cryptos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Memeinator – The new meme coin opportunity not to be missed</strong></h3>



<p>Memeinator, supported by an addictive game and plenty of utility, perfectly captures the spirit of the current <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/03/06/the-5-must-have-meme-coins-in-the-current-bull-rush/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme coin</a> uprising. Memeinator&#8217;s blend of sophisticated AI, community-driven gameplay, and a mission to clean up the meme coin space presents an unprecedented chance to invest in a project with explosive potential.</p>



<p>As we approach the end of its presale phase in Q1, and with Memeinator being in stage 18 of 20, the urgency of participating in Memeinator&#8217;s explosive world is palpable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With only 64,655,172 tokens remaining and stages selling out swiftly, the FOMO is definitely real. It is the last chance for American investors and crypto enthusiasts alike to seize this fleeting opportunity before Memeinator catapults into the crypto stratosphere.</p>

<p>The open interest, development activity, volatility, price, volume, and market cap chart for the XLM asset are showing bullish traits and could show more growth in the future.</p>



<p>XLM demonstrated good performance last week, last month, and the last three months by 6.43%, 29.00%, and 17.15% respectively, indicating a reliable upward trend.</p>



<p>The crypto experienced a 4.31% surge in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.1461. Stellar is making the higher high structure and aims to shatter the nearest hurdle to retest the supply level at $0.19000. The XLM crypto appears to be poised for the continuation of this spectacular rally to smash the $0.1590 resistance level and soar to new heights.</p>



<p>The Stellar asset is showing bullish strength and rising potential as it stays above major 20 and 50-Day EMAs. The MACD shows a bullish cross with a histogram at 0.001238, the MACD is at 0.007378, and the signal line is at 0.006138. Correspondingly, the RSI shows no signs of overbought conditions yet and the curve is at 67.55, suggesting that the XLM asset has more room to grow.</p>



<p>On the flip side, if the XLM price fails to stay above the $0.1188 level, it could decline further towards the demand zone.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Open Interest chart shows Positive Gestures</strong></h2>



<p>The OI data shows the total number of open contracts in the Stellar crypto. The<a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/03/09/oi-development-volatility-shows-more-upside-in-ocean-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> OI data analysis</a> shows a steady rise in the number of OI contracts in recent sessions. During the past session, open contracts rose from 17.21 Million to 32 Million. </p>



<p>However, there has been a short-term OI decline up to 25 Million and its most recent sessions currently stand at 28.24 Million. This highlights XLM crypto’s potential for a rise in future sessions.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Price, Volume, and Market Cap Demonstrate</strong></h2>



<p>The Stellar chart shows the relationship between the XLM token&#8217;s volume and price. The chart shows that both asset volume and price were declining in January. That meant a lack of interest and activity in the market for the XLM token. Volumes was mostly under $80 Million and the price was around $0.110.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, in the second week of February, volume and its price continued to increase, illustrating increased demand and excitement about Stellar crypto price. The trading volume exceeded $150 Million and the price rose drastically from $0.116 to $0.154.&nbsp;</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" title="Santiment Chart: Price (XLM), Volume (XLM), Marketcap (XLM)" width="1170" height="425" src="https://embed.santiment.net/chart?ps=stellar&#038;pt=XLM&#038;df=2023-09-11T18%3A29%3A59.542Z&#038;dt=2024-03-11T18%3A29%3A59.542Z&#038;emcg=1&#038;emhwm=1&#038;wm=price_usd%3Bvolume_usd%3Bmarketcap_usd&#038;wax=0%3B1%3B2&#038;wc=%2326C953%3B%23D2D6E7%3B%23FF5B5B&#038;ws=%7B%22node%22%3A%22area%22%7D%3B%3B" scrolling="no"></iframe>



<p>Moreover, at press time, the current volume is 218.72 Million, and the market capitalization is $4.18 billion.</p>



<p>It is essential to consider the trading volume of Stellar in conjunction with the market cap. A high market cap with low trading volume in XLM price might indicate limited liquidity, making it harder to buy or sell without affecting the price, and a high trading volume in Stellar crypto might signify vast liquidity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Stellar Crypto Volatility Chart Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>This chart exhibits the contrast between volatility and price movement in the Stellar crypto. On examination, it shows that the XLM crypto has witnessed tremendous growth in recent sessions, and the volatility has advanced much as well. It illustrated less stability in the price at the higher level which led Stellar price to show a pullback with the volatility declining steadily. Selling pressure is declining from the rear and could continue the ascent and take off on an XLM price rally.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Development Activity Chart Of XLM Crypto</strong></h2>



<p>The development and developers activity count shows the recent updates and changes occurring in the XLM crypto. On close observation of the charts, it was seen that the development activity and the developer count has grown gradually since the start of 2024.</p>



<p>Similarly, it also positively impacted the Stellar price as the crypto surged in the second week of February, after a price correction on the daily chart. The recent Development Activity is 25.74, and the Developers Activity Contributors Commit Count at 3.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Summary</strong></h3>



<p>The OI data analysis saw a steady advance in the number of OI contracts in the recent sessions. In the recent sessions, it illustrated less stability in the price at the higher level which led XLM to pull back.</p>



<p>On close observation of the charts, it was seen that the development activity and the developer count have been rising gradually since the start of 2024, as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the open interest, development activity, price, volume, and market cap chart for the XLM asset show bullish traits. The XLM crypto appears to be poised for a continuation of this spectacular rally, to smash the resistance level of $0.1590 and soar to new heights.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Floki Inu Crypto Social Dominance And Volume Chart</strong></h2>



<p>The social dominance including Floki news, X (formerly Twitter) followers, and social volume (including active users of Telegram and X), displays a positive trajectory; there is also a massive uptick in active users and X chatter. These metrics confirm that Floki Inu is popular.</p>

<p>The most bullish outlook of our analysts assumes the NEAR price could continue drawing an upward trajectory till $10 as the highest price in March 2024. On the other hand, the negative outlook of the analysts assumes the price may break below the recent support of a round level of $5 below which it may drop to $4, and the dynamic support level of the 200-Day EMA.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Green Bitcoin ($GBTC) is an eco-friendly Bitcoin alternative fired up for a bullish spree in March 2024!</strong></h2>



<p>One of the coins fired up for a bullish spree in March 2024 is the young Green Bitcoin ($GBTC), a crypto that caught the eye not only of environmentally conscious crypto users but also of the wider crypto community.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2021/03/28/what-are-green-bitcoin-and-a-clean-energy-mining-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Green Bitcoin</a> ($GBTC) seems like an attractive option not only because it is 10,000 times more environmentally friendly than the original Bitcoin, and thus directly affects the improvement of the environment, but also because it offers fantastic profit opportunities.</p>



<p>This innovative predict-2-earn coin allows users to win huge rewards and bonuses by predicting Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements. $GBTC, experts say, is fired up for a bullish spree right after the end of its presale, and the great news is that you still have the opportunity to grab this high-potential coin at a presale price of only $0.6882!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><a href="https://bs_795168e1.coinrepublic.care?referrer=7-coins-geared-up-for-a-bullish-spree-in-march-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&gt;&gt;&gt; Buy Green Bitcoin Now&lt;&lt;&lt;</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smog Token ($SMOG) is a high-potential Solana meme coin that could achieve outstanding results during March!</strong></h3>



<p>The young Solana meme coin, Smog Token ($SMOG), could also achieve outstanding results during March. Crypto users went &#8220;crazy&#8221; for the $SMOG token because by owning this high-potential coin, they get the opportunity to participate in the biggest Solana airdrop of all time and to win fantastic prizes constantly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>$SMOG is the top choice of many investors because it is already described as a potentially 100x meme coin, and another reason why investors want to grab it in March is because of the current opportunity to use the 10% discount.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sponge Token V2 ($SPONGEV2) is one of the most promising meme coins set for impressive results in March 2024.</strong></h3>



<p>Another <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/03/04/trumps-maga-meme-coin-growth-the-first-polifi-experiment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme coin</a> that could achieve impressive results in March is the &#8220;improved version&#8221; of the $SPONGE token: Sponge Token V2 ($SPONGEV2).&nbsp;</p>



<p>$SPONGEV2, through the introduction of the P2E game and other innovations, threatens to surpass not only its &#8220;older brother&#8221; but also many other established meme coins. Crypto experts believe that all these new things that $SPONGEV2 brings, combined with the growing user interest, will help this meme coin reach the top!</p>

<p>For many reasons, more and more users are looking to include Scotty the AI ($SCOTTY) in their crypto portfolio before the next bull run. First and foremost, experts suggest that this coin has explosive potential and could achieve impressive growth in value immediately after the end of its presale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another reason is related to the revolutionary features that this AI crypto offers to users. In addition to the fantastic and extremely useful Scotty Chat and Scotty Swap apps, high interest for $SCOTTY is undoubtedly related to its current presale price of only $0.0083 per token!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Frog Wif Hat Token ($FWIF) is another crypto that meme coin enthusiasts have fallen in love with!</strong></h3>



<p>Meme coin enthusiasts have already fallen in love with the cute young meme coin inspired by French culture, Frog Wif Hat Token ($FWIF).</p>



<p>Crypto experts believe that the time has come to forget $PEPE and to give a chance to the next 100x investment sensation, the $FWIF token, which threatens to surpass all last year’s biggest meme coin gainers!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><a href="https://bs_f0ddeeb4.coinrepublic.care?referrer=7-coins-geared-up-for-a-bullish-spree-in-march-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">>>> Buy Frog Wif Hat Token Now&lt;&lt;&lt;</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Peen Coin ($PEEN) is a unique meme coin that is capturing the attention of crypto investors!</strong></h3>



<p>March 2024 is, without a doubt, the month in which interest in meme coins dominates, and one of those around which there is a gigantic hype is the unique Peen Coin ($PEEN). There&#8217;s no doubt that $PEEN is shocking the crypto community with its uniqueness, and that&#8217;s probably where its biggest advantage lies.</p>



<p>$PEEN could bring &#8220;the biggest meme coin eruption of the year,&#8221; and <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2023/05/20/crypto-experts-choose-sparklo-sprk-over-terra-classic-and-polygon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto experts </a>believe that with a little initial warm-up, this meme coin will grow to unprecedented proportions.</p>



<p>$PEEN has already entered the crypto world and made crypto users go crazy for it without any additional stimulation, and it&#8217;s just the beginning of its journey. You can only imagine how much this meme coin will grow after a little foreplay!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cardano ($ADA) could achieve fine results in March 2024.</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2022/11/28/cardano-ada-network-noted-the-massive-wallet-growth-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardano ($ADA) </a>recorded good results at the beginning of March, and during the last week, it achieved a value growth of almost 10%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Predictions suggest that $ADA will continue with this price growth and that it could achieve a maximum value of around $0.77 at the end of March, which is a pretty solid result.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><a href="https://coinrepublic.care/b_btcmtx_43675?referrer=7-coins-geared-up-for-a-bullish-spree-in-march-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">&gt;&gt;&gt; Buy The Best Crypto Now&lt;&lt;&lt;</a></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>

<p>The Coreum price has secured a 3-day gaining streak and is looking to appreciate further to close in green. The bulls were dominating in the last few sessions and are expected to continue the same in the coming sessions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At press time, the COREUM price was trading close to $0.157, recording a 0.19% drop. The daily chart displays volatility in the recent sessions, thus leading to a consolidation. The $0.138 and $0.158 levels are acting as the lower and upper boundary of the consolidation respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The recent consolidation has erased the selling pressure that was created in February after COREUM price crashed from the highs and broke the previous support level at $0.15 directly. The short-term outlook has shifted from bearish to sideways as the buyers made a comeback at the lower levels and prevented further fall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The FTX Token price is extending the losses on Monday after failing to gain buyers’ trust above the 200-Day EMA yesterday. The price suffered rejection from the 200-Day EMA and dropped lower, suggesting the presence of bears near the 200-Day EMA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the recent session saw the domination of buyers after the price took a rebound from the previous breakout zone of $1.6 level. The FTT crypto topped out near $5.66 in mid-December and dropped lower thus entering a correction phase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since December, the buyers have been on the losing side as the price dropped steadily, forming lower highs. FTX token price has eroded nearly 60% from the December 2023 highs.</p>



<p>Currently, the FTT price is experiencing a correction phase and has been a sell-on-rise opportunity for short-term traders and investors. The bears have established themselves near the $3 level which is the recent swing high. The crypto may experience selling pressure until the price is maintained below the recent supply.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FTX Token Crypto Volume Drops As The Price Rise?</strong></h2>



<p>Moreover, the volume analysis shows that the FTT cryptocurrency recovered in the recent session after a sharp dip. However, the volume rise was steady and dropped as the FTX token price neared the previous supply zone.</p>
